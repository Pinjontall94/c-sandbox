# C Sandbox
A minimal C project to make this relic of the 70s as close to scripting as I
can get ;/ Uses C2X as default, with Wall, Wextra, and pedantic flags on. 
Makefile could be more scalable, but was left intentionally short, much like
this README.

## Use
Change main.c? Run the following to get the new output:
```
make && make run
```

Have at it ðŸ¤
